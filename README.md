# ML-BiGAMP
Matlab code of ML-BiGAMP



This repository provides the implementation of multi-layer bilinear generalized approximate message passing (ML-BiGAMP), which can be found in arXiv: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.00436.pdf

This repository includes 6 experiments. 

The 1st experiment (EXP1) verified the consistency of ML-BiGAMP and its SE in 2-layer model. 

The 2nd experiment (EXP2) provided SNR versus BER of pilot-only, JCD, and Perfect-CSI scheme. 

The 3rd experiment (EXP3) shown the influence of Kp/Kd on the JCD scheme. 

The 4th experiment (EXP4) compared ML-BiGAMP with ML-Mat-VAMP in 3-layer model. 

The 5th experiment (EXP5) gave the applicaiton of ML-BiGAMP in compressive matrix completion. 

The 6th experiment (EXP6) shown the consistency of ML-BiGAMP and  its SE in 1-layer model.
